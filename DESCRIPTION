Description: Functions to automate downloading geospatial data available
    from several federated data sources (mainly sources maintained by the
    US Federal government). Currently, the package enables extraction from
    seven datasets: The National Elevation Dataset digital elevation
    models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS); The National Hydrography Dataset
    (USGS); The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database from the National
    Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources
    Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA; the Global Historical
    Climatology Network (GHCN), coordinated by National Climatic Data
    Center at NOAA; the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather
    parameters for North America, version 3, available from the Oak Ridge
    National Laboratory's Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC); the
    International Tree Ring Data Bank; and the National Land Cover
    Database (NLCD).
